# üìä COVID-19 Analysis Python Project

## üß† Project Overview

This project analyzes how **COVID-19** spread globally over time, focusing on identifying the most impacted regions, total deaths, recoveries, testing patterns, and leading causes of death associated with the pandemic. The goal is to apply data analysis and visualization techniques to extract meaningful insights from real-world data.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Utilize a COVID-19 dataset sourced from **GeeksforGeeks**
- Apply data wrangling and visualization techniques using **Python**
- Answer key questions such as:
  - Which countries and regions were most affected?
  - What are the trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths?
  - What were the most common underlying causes of COVID-19-related deaths?

## ‚úÖ Key Findings

After thorough analysis, the following insights were uncovered:

- The **most infected country** is **USA (North America)** with over **5,032,179** total confirmed cases.
- **North America** experienced the highest number of deaths: **162,804**.
- The region also led in **recoveries**, with **2,576,668** people recovered.
- The **most COVID-19 tests** were conducted in **North America**: **63,139,605** tests.
- The **leading causes of death** include:
  - **Influenza and Pneumonia**
  - **Coronavirus**
  - **Chronic Lower Respiratory Diseases**
